## Data Modeling - Employees data model (with code)
I used quick database diagrams (https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/) to put together my ERD (entity relationship diagram) of the data tables.

I then took a screen shot of my diagram (with the code used to develop it) and saved it as a jpg file.

## Data Engineering - SQL tables
I created the tables in postgreSQL and imported the corresponding csv files/

The employees.csv file needed some date reformatting before the data could be imported. The dates were originally formatted as DD/MM/YYYY. SQL reads dates as YYYY/MM/DD and so I had to reformat the dates accordingly.

## Data analysis - SQL queries
I formulated most 8 queries using table joins of various kinds as needed. Queries 2 and 8 did not involce joins, instead they involved filtering and grouping data from the employees table to meet different conditions.
